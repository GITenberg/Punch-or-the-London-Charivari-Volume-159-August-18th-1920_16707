<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>

  <p>The grouse-shooting reports are coming in. Already one of the
  newly-rich has sent a brace of gamekeepers to the local hospital.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A few hours in Cork," says a <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent, "will
  convince anyone that a civil war is near." A civil war, it should be
  explained, is one in which the civilians are at war but the military are
  not.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Lisburn Urban Council has decided to buy an army hut for use as a day
  nursery. It is this policy of petty insult that is bound in the end to
  goad the military forces in Ireland to reprisals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Who invented railways?" asks a weekly paper. We can only say we know
  somebody who butted in later.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Mr. Churchill," says a contemporary, "has some friends still." It
  will be noticed that they are very still.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"It may interest your readers to know," writes a correspondent, "that
  it would take four days and nights, seven hours, fifty-two minutes and
  ten seconds to count one day's circulation of <i>The Daily Mail</i>."
  Holiday-makers waiting for the shower to blow over should certainly try
  it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Coloured grocery sugars, the <font class="sc">Food Controller</font>
  announces, are to be freed from control on September 6th. A coloured
  grocery is one in which the grocer is not as black as he is painted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A conference of sanitary inspectors at Leeds has been considering the
  question, "When is a house unfit for habitation?" The most dependable
  sign is the owner's description of it as a "charming old-world
  residence."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Warrington Watch Committee, says a news item, have before them an
  unusual number of applications for pawnbrokers' licences. In the absence
  of any protest from the Sleeve Links and Scarf Pin Committee they will
  probably be granted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I earn three pounds and fourpence a week," an applicant told the
  Willesden Police Court, "out of which I give my wife three pounds." The
  man may be a model husband, of course, but before taking it for granted
  we should want to know what he does with that fourpence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Scarborough Corporation has fitted up and let a number of bathing vans
  for eight shillings a week each. To avoid overcrowding not more than
  three families will be allowed to live in one van.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Three times in four days," says a <i>Daily Express</i> report, "a
  Parisian has thrown his wife out of a bedroom window." Later reports
  point out that all is now quiet, as the fellow has found his
  collar-stud.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Who Will Fight For England?" asks a headline. To avoid ill-feeling a
  better plan would be to get Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> to
  give it to you.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A noiseless gun has just been invented. It will now be possible to
  wage war without the enemy complaining of headache.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Everyone sending clothes to a laundry should mark them plainly so
  that they can be easily recognised," advises a weekly journal. It is nice
  to know that should an article not come back again you will be able to
  assure yourself that it was yours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At the present moment, we read, dogs are being imported in large
  numbers. It should be pointed out, however, that dachshunds are still
  sold in lengths.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A contemporary complains of the high cost of running a motor-car
  to-day. It is not so much the high price of petrol, we gather, as the
  rising cost of pedestrian.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The police, while investigating a case of burglary in a railway
  buffet, discovered a bent crowbar. This seems to prove that the thieves
  tried to break into a railway sandwich.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mexican rebels have been ordered to stop indiscriminate shooting. It
  is feared that the supply of Presidential Candidates is in danger of
  running out.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A Manchester octogenarian has just married a woman of eighty-six,"
  says a news item. It should be pointed out, however, that he obtained her
  parents' consent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Although the old penny bun is now sold for twopence or even
  threepence it contains three times the number of currants," announces an
  evening paper. This should mean three currants in each bun.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A parrot belonging to a bargee escaped near Atherstone in Warwickshire
  last week and has not yet been recaptured. We understand that all
  children under fourteen living in the neighbourhood are being kept
  indoors, whilst local golfers have been sent out to act as decoys.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is announced that a baby born in Ramsgate on August 6th is to be
  christened "Geddes." We are given to understand that the news has not yet
  been broken to the unfortunate infant.</p>

<h2>FROM SPA AND SHORE.</h2>

  <p><font class="sc">Grogtown</font>.&mdash;All available accommodation
  has been monopolised by Glasborough visitors, among whom this resort is
  becoming more alarmingly popular every year. Sixty charabancs arrived on
  Monday and the Riot Act was read several times before the passengers
  could be induced to desist from their badinage of the residents, most of
  whom have since retired behind the wire-entanglements at Kelrose. The
  municipal orchestra was subjected to a brisk fusillade of rock-cakes on
  Saturday night; the conductor and several of the instrumentalists
  suffered contusions, and their performances have since been discontinued.
  This has not unnaturally given rise to a certain amount of
  dissatisfaction amongst the visitors, but otherwise there has been no
  recrudescence of rioting. A company of the Caithness Highlanders, with
  machine-guns, are now encamped on the links, and sunshine is all that is
  needed to complete the success of the season.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Kegness</font>.&mdash;On Tuesday the Mayor presented
  a jar of whisky, fifty years old, to the winning charabanc team in the
  bottle-throwing competition, and the subsequent scenes afforded much
  diversion. A notable feature at present is a large whale, which was
  washed ashore in a gale about six months ago. The oldest inhabitants
  declare that they have never known anything like it, and it is certainly
  an unforgettable experience to be anywhere within a mile of this
  apparently immovable derelict. Excursions to all surrounding places out
  of nose-shot are extremely popular, and the beach is practically deserted
  save by a few juvenile natives engaged in the blubber industry.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Mudhall Spa</font>.&mdash;Without the least
  reflection on chalybeates and the rest, it must be allowed that the most
  popular beverage in Mudhall at present is that which draws its virtue
  from a cereal and not a mineral source. Hilarity is rife at all hours,
  and the effort to enlist a body of local volunteers to control the
  exuberance of anti-Sabbatarian "charabankers" is meeting with unexpected
  support. The casualties in the daily collisions between the Hydropathic
  League and the Anti-Pussy-Foot-Guards are steadily increasing and now
  compare favourably with those of any other Midland health-resort.</p>

<hr />

  <blockquote>
  <p>"A Boylston (Massachusetts) farm labourer is said to havt bees
  identified as one of the heirs to a £400,000 estate at Dundte, for whom
  starches have betn made for years, but nothing is known at Dundee of such
  an estate."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>But this lucid paragraph should help to clear up the mystery.</p>

<hr />

<h2>AMONG THE PEDESTALS.</h2>

  <p>The rumour that a number of London's statues are to be moved to make
  room for new has caused many a marble heart to beat faster; and on making
  a round of calls I gathered that Sir <font class="sc">Alfred Mond</font>
  has few friends in stone or bronze circles. Not the least uneasy is
  George IV. in Trafalgar Square. Uneasiness of body he has always known,
  riding there for ever without any stirrups; but now his mind is uneasy
  too. "If they take Father from Cockspur Street," he argued very
  naturally, "why not me?"</p>

  <p>A few of the figures feel secure, of course, but very few. Nelson on
  his column has no fears; Nurse Cavell is too recent to tremble; so is
  Abraham Lincoln. But the others? They are in a state of nervous suspense,
  wondering if the sentence of banishment is to fall and resenting any
  disturbance of their lives. "<i>J'y suis, j'y reste</i>" is their
  motto.</p>

  <p>Abraham Lincoln gave me a hearty welcome and extended an invitation
  that is not within the power of any other graven image in the city. "Take
  a chair," he said.</p>

  <p>I did so and am thus, I suppose, the first Londoner to put that
  comfortable piece of furniture to its proper use.</p>

  <p>"How do you like being here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He said that he enjoyed it. The only blot on his pleasure was the fear
  that the Abbey might fall on him, and he therefore hoped that <i>The
  Times'</i> fund was progressing by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>His immediate neighbours, on the contrary, exhibited no serenity
  whatever, and I found Canning and Palmerston shivering with apprehension
  in their frockcoats. The worst of it was that I could say nothing to
  reassure them.</p>

  <p>Here and there, however, a desire for locomotion was expressed. Dr.
  Johnson, in the enclosure behind St. Clement Danes, is very restive. I
  asked him if he would object to removal. "Sir," said the Little
  Lexicographer (as his sculptor has made him), "I should derive
  satisfaction from it. A man cannot be considered as enviable who spends
  all his time in the contemplation, from an unvacatable position, of a
  street to the perambulation of which he devoted many of his happiest
  hours."</p>

  <p>I ventured to agree.</p>

  <p>"Nor," continued the sage, "is it a source of contentment to a man of
  integrity to observe an unceasing procession of Americans on their way to
  partake of pudding in a hostelry that has made its name and prosperity
  out of a mythical association with himself and be unable to correct the
  error."</p>

  <p>"Are you in general in favour of statuary?" I made bold to ask.</p>

  <p>"Painting," said he, "consumes labour not disproportionate to its
  effect; but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make
  something in stone that hardly resembles a man. Look around you; look at
  me. The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value
  the finest head cut upon a carrot."</p>

  <p>But one effect of this General Post among the statues is good, and it
  should delight Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font>. Cromwell, now outside
  Westminster Hall, is to be moved into the House.</p>

      <p>'Twas last week at Pebble Bay</p>
      <p class="i2">That I saw the little goat,</p>

      <p class="i2">Old was he and poor in coat,</p>

<h3>CRICKET NOTES.</h3>

  <p>Mr. P.F. <font class="sc">Warner</font> has received countless
  expressions of regret on his retirement from first-class cricket. Among
  these he values not least a "round robin" from the sparrows at Lord's,
  all of whom he knows by name. In the score-book of Fate is this entry in
  letters of gold:</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">The Unknown.</font>"</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Somerset Maugham</font>, who recently intrigued
  and perhaps just a little scandalised the town with a most engagingly
  flippant and piquant farce all about an accidentally bigamous beauty,
  certainly shows courage in launching so serious a discussion as <i>The
  Unknown</i>. And in the silly season too. I see that in a quite unlikely
  interview (but then all modern interviews are unlikely) he defends his
  right to discuss religion quite openly on the stage. Of course. Why
  should anybody deny that religion is to the normally constituted mind,
  whatever its doxy, an absorbingly interesting subject; or that the War
  hasn't made a breach in the barriers of British reticence? Whether to the
  point of making a perfectly good married Vicar (anxious to convict a
  doubting D.S.O. of sin) ask in a full drawing-room containing the
  Vicaress, the Doctor and the D.S.O.'s fiancée, mother and father, "For
  instance, have you always been perfectly chaste?"&mdash;I am not so sure.
  Nor whether the War has really added to bereaved <i>Mrs. Littlewood's</i>
  bitter "And who is going to forgive God?" any added force. If that kind
  of question is to be asked at all it might have been asked, and with
  perhaps more justice, at any time within the historical period. For the
  War might reasonably be attributed by the Unknown Defendant thus starkly
  put upon trial to man's deliberate folly, whereas....</p>

  <p>No doubt, however, Mr. <font class="sc">Maugham</font> would say the
  shock of war has (like any other great catastrophe) tested the faith of
  many who are personally deeply stricken and found it wanting, while the
  whisper of doubt has swelled the more readily as there are many to echo
  it. So <i>Major John Wharton, D.S.O., M.C.</i>, having found war,
  contrary to his expectation of it as the most glorious manly sport in the
  world, a "muddy, mad, stinking, bloody business," loses the faith of his
  youth and says so, not with bravado but with regret. The Vicar, with
  dignity and restraint, but without much understanding and not without
  some hoary <i>clichés</i>; his wife, with venom (suggesting also
  incidentally sound argument for the celibacy of the clergy); the old
  <i>Colonel</i> and his sweet unselfish wife, with affection; and
  <i>Sylvia</i>, <i>John's</i> betrothed, with a strange passion, defend
  the old faith, <i>Sylvia</i> to the point of breaking with her lover and
  getting her to a nunnery&mdash;a business which will in the end, I should
  guess, lay a heavier burden upon the nuns than upon <i>John</i>. The
  indecisive battle sways hither and thither. It is the <i>Doctor</i> who
  sums up in a compromise which would shock the metaphysical theologian,
  but may suffice for the plain man, "God is merciful but not omnipotent.
  In His age-long fight against evil we can help&mdash;or hinder; why not
  help?"</p>

  <p>The most signal thing was Miss <font class="sc">Haidée Wright's</font>
  personal triumph as <i>Mrs. Littlewood</i>&mdash;a very fine
  interpretation of an interesting character. Mr. <font class="sc">Charles
  V. France</font> adds another decent Colonel to his military repertory.
  This actor always plays with distinction and with an ease of which the
  art is so cleverly concealed as perhaps to rob him of his due meed of
  applause from the unperceptive. Lady <font class="sc">Tree</font> made a
  beautiful thing of the character of <i>Mrs. Wharton</i>, whose simple
  unselfishness was the best of all Mr. <font class="sc">Maugham's</font>
  arguments for the defence. Mr. R.H. <font class="sc">Hignett</font> nobly
  restrained himself from making a too parsonic parson, yet kept enough of
  the distinctive flavour to excite a passionate anti-clerical behind me
  into clamorously derisive laughter; a very good piece of work. Miss <font
  class="sc">O'Malley</font> acted a difficult, almost an impossibly
  difficult, part with a fine distinction. Mr. <font class="sc">Basil
  Rathbone's</font> <i>Major</i> and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Blakiston's</font> <i>Doctor</i> were excellent. I am sorry to
  be so monotonously approving....</p>

  <p>I am not convinced that Mr. <font class="sc">Maugham's</font>
  experiment has succeeded.</p>

<h2>THE MYSTERY.</h2>

  <p>George and I are two ordinary people. He studies the Weather Reports
  every day; I do occasionally. He thinks he understands meteorology; I
  don't. But lately I felt that I <i>must</i> have some explanation of the
  weather, so I asked George to explain it.</p>

  <p>He said, "Certainly; it's quite simple. Take wind. Wind is caused by
  differences of <i>pressure</i>."</p>

  <p>"What <i>is</i> pressure? Who is pressing what?"</p>

  <p>"Pressure is what the barometer tells you&mdash;not the thermometer;
  you must keep the thermometer out of this. Suppose it is very hot in
  London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose it is very hot at a place A&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought we were keeping the thermometer out of this."</p>

  <p>"It comes in indirectly. But don't keep interrupting. If it is very
  hot at the place A, the air at A rises. You see?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Obviously it does. If you light a candle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I do see that. Don't begin about candles."</p>

  <p>"Well, the result of that is that there is less <i>pressure</i> at A.
  In other words, there is more room for the air to move about. When that
  happens the air at the place B&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh anywhere. I told you to think of two places, A and B."</p>

  <p>"No, you told me to think of a place A, and I am still thinking of it,
  because it is very hot there."</p>

  <p>"Well, this is another place, where the pressure is simply frightful.
  When the air rises at A the air from B rushes over to A to fill up the
  gap, and that is what we call wind."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>"No, you don't. It isn't quite so simple as that. Now, the atoms of
  air rushing from B to A don't go <i>straight</i> there, but they travel
  in&mdash;in sort of <i>circles</i>."</p>

  <p>"Why do they do that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact is that these atoms are so keen to get over to A,
  where there is plenty of room, that they jostle each other, and that
  makes them go round and round. If they go round and round <i>against</i>
  the clock, like that, they are called cyclones, or depressions, or
  low-pressure systems. If they go with the clock, like that, it is an
  anti-cyclone."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;'Oh'?"</p>

  <p>"What I said; but go on."</p>

  <p>"Now suppose this air&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which air?"</p>

  <p>"The air from B. Suppose it is travelling in a cyclone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But isn't a cyclone a low-pressure thingummy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And didn't you say that B was a high-pressure place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then how does the air coming from B manage to be low-pressure
  stuff?"</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean. There <i>is</i> an explanation, but it would
  take too long to hazard it now. Suppose the air is coming from B in an
  anti-cyclone, then ..."</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll suppose that."</p>

  <p>"... it rushes over to A and fills up the gap. There is more pressure
  at A and the barometer goes up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it fine then?"</p>

  <p>"No, it rains. You see, the air from B is colder than the air at A was
  before the air came from B."</p>

  <p>"I <i>don't</i> see."</p>

  <p>"Well, obviously it <i>must</i> be."</p>

  <p>"How 'obviously'?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the whole thing started with it being very hot at A, you
  remember, so that the air rose. If it had been hotter still at B just
  then the air would have risen at B instead, and it couldn't have rushed
  over to A. There'd have been a frightful muddle."</p>

  <p>"There is."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's your own fault for interrupting. This air,
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which air is this?"</p>

  <p>"The air from B. The air from B cools the air at A&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I thought the air at A had risen."</p>

  <p>"Not all of it. And that makes it rain."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I can't go into that. It's something to do with
  condensation. Air absorbs more moisture when it is hot than when it is
  cold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So do I. I understand that."</p>

  <p>"When the air cools the water condenses."</p>

  <p>"Is it fine then?"</p>

  <p>"No, it rains, you fool."</p>

  <p>"When is it fine?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit. The falling of the rain of course generates
  heat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why 'of course'?"</p>

  <p>"I can't explain <i>exactly</i>, but you know perfectly well that it's
  always warmer on a cold day after the rain."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but not on a hot day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't."</p>

  <p>"It is, really. Anyhow, this is a cold day."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't. You said it was very hot at A."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to argue. You must take it from me that rain generates
  heat."</p>

  <p>"All right. Is it fine then?"</p>

  <p>"No. Heat being generated the air rises. The result of that is that
  there is less <i>pressure</i> at A&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it fine then?"</p>

  <p>"I've explained already what happens then. The air from B&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do we begin all over again now?"</p>

  <p>"More or less, yes."</p>

  <p>"So that at this place, A, it's always raining or just going to
  rain?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if it starts by being hot there, as it did just now, I suppose
  it is."</p>

  <p>"What happens if it starts by being cold?"</p>

  <p>"It rains. I've explained that. The cold air can't contain so much
  moisture&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't begin that again. What about B? Is it any good going there? We
  had frightfully high pressure there at one time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it rains so much at A that more and more air rushes from B
  to A to fill up the gap caused by the air rising on account of the heat
  generated by the rain falling, and very soon you get frightfully low
  pressure at B&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it fine then?"</p>

  <p>"No, it rains."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me. But suppose it had started by being low pressure at
  B?"</p>

  <p>"Why, then of course it would have been raining the whole time at
  B."</p>

  <p>"Where would A have got its rush of air from then?"</p>

  <p>"From the place C."</p>

  <p>"Is it fine there?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's raining. It is like B was after the air rose at A."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Then whatever happens at these places, A, B and C, it <i>must</i>
  rain."</p>

  <p>"More or less, yes. More really."</p>

  <p>"Are there any more places? I mean, if I am at A where ought I to
  go?"</p>

  <p>"There is a place, D&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What happens there?"</p>

  <p>"Conditions are favourable for the formation of secondary
  depressions."</p>

  <p>"Then where do you advise me to go?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not advising you. You asked me to explain the weather, and I
  have."</p>

<h2>THE TRANSMIGRATION OF BOWLES.</h2>

  <p>Little Mr. Bowles was very happy as long as he was only second
  mechanic at the garage of Messrs. Smith Brothers, of High Street,
  Puddlesby. It was when he became a member of the Puddlesby Psychical
  Society that his troubles began. Up till then he had been as sober and
  hard-working a little man as ever stood four foot ten in his shoes and
  weighed in at seven stone four. But above all he was an expert in rubber
  tyres; he knew them, I had almost said, by instinct.</p>

  <p>The Puddlesby Psychical Society believes in the Transmigration of
  Souls. As I am not a member myself I'm afraid that that is all I can tell
  you about it. It is a little difficult at first sight, perhaps, to see
  the connection between Transmigration and rubber tyres, but if you will
  have patience I think I can promise to show you <i>that</i> at least.</p>

  <p>One night our Mr. Bowles came home late from a meeting of the P.P.S.,
  fell asleep at once and had what he regarded as a "transmigratory
  experience in a retrogressive sense." The world was not the world he
  knew. He perceived that it was sundown on the 8th of August, 1215, that
  he was no longer plain Bowles, but rather Sir Bors the Bowless, Knight of
  the Artful Arm, and known to his intimates as "The Fire-eater"; that he
  had just been challenged to fight his seven hundred and forty-seventh
  fight, and (for the seven hundred and forty-seventh time) he had
  accepted. He soon added to the stock of his information the fact that, as
  the challenged party, he had the choice of time, place and weapons.</p>

  <p>He was naturally a little perturbed at first, for the most formidable
  warrior that he ever remembered fighting was his little sister, whose
  hair he had pulled when they were children, and the biggest thing he had
  ever killed was undoubtedly the hen that he had run over on the Boodle
  Road. He felt inclined, therefore, in the first flush of terror, to
  propose as the time 1925, as the place Puddlesby Football Field, and as
  the weapon, motor-tyre valve pins, at two hundred yards. He even got as
  far as mentioning these conditions to his friend Sir Hugh the Hairy, who,
  however, did not seem particularly struck with the suggestion, but made a
  counter-proposal of maces on horseback at the neighbouring lists in three
  days' time.</p>

  <p>Before our hero knew what he was about he found that he had agreed. He
  got through a deal of heavy thinking on his way home to his castle, but
  had fortunately completed his plan of campaign before he arrived, for the
  esquire of his enemy was awaiting him there, demanding to know the
  details of the coming contest. He made the conditions suggested by Sir
  Hugh, merely adding that the maces must be smooth and not knobbed, as was
  customary in the better-class combats of that day.</p>

  <p>He then began to make his preparations. At first he was considerably
  depressed by the entire absence of all rubber, until dire necessity
  compelled him to find a serviceable substitute in the shape of untanned
  ox-skins. These he carefully sewed together with his own knightly hands,
  coating the stitches over with pitch and resin. He was a good workman and
  did not fail to be ready in time.</p>

  <p>When the hour of combat arrived he vanished into the painted pavilion
  reserved for him at one end of the lists, accompanied only by his
  faithful esquire. Hastily he donned his suiting of reinforced ox-hide,
  which covered the whole of his person from head to foot, and hung stiffly
  in folds all round him. Then, holding out a metal tube which was attached
  to the front of the costume, he presented it to his esquire, saying in
  the vernacular of those stout times&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ho, varlet! Blow me down yon hole till there be no more breath in thy
  vile bodie. Blow me hard and leally. Blow an thou burst in ye
  blowinge."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the trusty varlet blew.</p>

  <p>Thus it fell out that when the trumpet sounded and the Black Baron of
  Beaumaris, his foe, rode forth from his sable pavilion, armed cap-à-pie
  in a suit of highly-polished steel and bestriding a black and rather
  over-dressed charger, he saw through the chinks of his lowered visor an
  object which he would undoubtedly have mistaken for a diminutive
  observation balloon if he had lived a few centuries later. In short, Sir
  Bowles, having been sufficiently inflated by his now exhausted esquire,
  had inserted his valve-pin into the tube (which he had tucked away and
  laced up like an association football), and now emerged upon the lists
  with a feeling of elation that he had not experienced for several
  days.</p>

  <p>They approached each other. It was with some difficulty that our hero
  wielded his mace, owing, first, to the inflated condition of his right
  arm, and, secondly, to the unaccustomed weight of the weapon. His hold
  also upon his curvetting steed was a little precarious, and he hoped that
  no one in the crowd would notice the string that tied his legs together
  beneath the horse's belly.</p>

  <p>If the Baron was surprised at what he saw he made no sign, but, riding
  straight at his strange antagonist, he dealt him a mighty blow on the
  left side of the head, which had quite an unlooked-for result. The string
  which attached our hero's legs held, it is true, but he naturally lost
  his balance, and, being knocked to the right, disappeared temporarily
  from the Baron's view. But the force of his swing was such that, at the
  moment when he was head downwards under the horse, he still had enough
  way on to bring him up again on the other side. No sooner had he regained
  a vertical position than the Baron repeated the blow on the same spot and
  with the same result.</p>

  <p>Then the same thing happened again and again; and indeed Sir Bowles
  might have revolved indefinitely, to the intense delight of the
  distinguished audience, had not the string broken at the thirty-fourth
  revolution.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>

  <p>Now the involuntary movements of our hero had accelerated at every
  turn, and when finally he parted company with his trusty steed he was
  going very fast indeed. Falling near the edge of the lists, he found
  touch, first bounce, in the Royal Box, whence some officious persons
  rolled him back again into the field of play.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that poor Sir Bowles was comfortable during
  these proceedings. The rather ingenious apparatus whereby he had hoped to
  catch a glimpse of his adversary had got out of order at the first
  onslaught, and he was in total darkness. Moreover, he soon discovered
  that the haughty Baron was taking all sorts of liberties with him; was
  slogging him round the lists; in short, was playing polo with him.</p>

  <p>But apart from the physical and mental discomfort of his situation he
  was not actually hurt, and at length he felt himself come to rest. The
  Baron, worn out by his unproductive labours, was thinking.</p>

  <p>So was Bowles. He was just saying to himself, "Thank heaven I thought
  of choosing <i>smooth</i> maces. A spike would have punctured the cover
  in no time," when he felt something which made his hair stand on end.</p>

  <p>His enemy was fumbling at the lacing of his tunic!</p>

  <p>Then poor little Sir Bowles gave himself up for lost and almost
  swooned away. He felt the Baron undo the lace and pull out the tube.
  There was a perplexed pause....</p>

  <p>And just as the Baron was pulling out the valve pin little Mr. Bowles
  woke with a shriek.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I suppose it was the fact that he had come straight from a symposium
  on transmigration that made little Bowles imagine he had been recurring
  to a previous existence. I myself should have thought that the rules of
  the game required the reincarnation of Sir Bors to be a rather more
  bloodthirsty and pugnacious person than our hero; and the sequel seems to
  prove that little Bowles thought the same. I think he felt he was not
  quite the man for this sort of rough work, even in the retrospect of
  dreams. Anyway, shortly after his painful experience he withdrew his
  subscription from the Puddlesby Psychical Society and ceased for ever to
  assist at their séances.</p>

<h2>CHANGES IN CLUB-LAND.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Student of Manners.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Roman satirist sang of poets reciting their verses in the month of
  August. If he were alive now he would find as fruitful a subject in the
  renovations and decorations of Clubland. Clubs are strange institutions;
  they go in for Autumn not Spring cleaning. Happily all Clubs are not
  renovated at the same time, otherwise the destitution of members would be
  pitiful to contemplate. Even as it is the temporary accommodation offered
  by their neighbours is not unattended by serious drawbacks. The standard
  of efficiency in bridge and billiards is not the same; the cuisine of one
  Club, though admirable in itself, may not suit the digestions of members
  of another; the opportunities for repose vary considerably. In short,
  August and September are trying months for the clubman who is obliged to
  remain in London. But by October Pall Mall is itself again, and we are
  glad to be able to state that in certain Clubs the amenities and comforts
  available will be greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>For example the Megatherium, which is now in the hands of the
  decorators, is being painted a pale pink outside, a colour which recent
  experiments have shown to exert a peculiarly humanising and
  tranquillising influence on persons of an irritable disposition. A
  sumptuous dormitory is being erected on the top floor, where slow music
  will be discoursed every afternoon, from three to seven, by a
  Czecho-Slovak orchestra. A roof-garden is being laid out for the
  recreation of the staff, and the velocity of the numerous lifts has been
  keyed up to concert pitch. Steam heat will be conveyed from the basement
  to radiators on every floor, and each room is being provided with a
  vacuum-cleaning apparatus, a wireless telephonic outfit and an American
  bar. The renovation of the library is practically complete, the obsolete
  books which cumbered its shelves having been replaced by the works of
  <font class="sc">Dell, Barclay, Wells, Zane Grey</font> and <font
  class="sc">Bennett</font>. Three interesting rumours about the future of
  the Club may be given with due reserve&mdash;the first, that in the near
  future women will be admitted to membership; the second, that Lord
  Ascliffe has obtained a complete control of its resources; and the third,
  that its name will be shortly changed to "Alfred's," on the analogy of
  "Arthur's."</p>

  <p><i>Monday, August, 9th.</i>&mdash;In an atmosphere of appropriate
  gloom the House of Lords discussed the latest Coercion Bill for Ireland.
  Even the <font class="sc">Lord Chancellor</font> could say little more
  for the measure than that it might possibly enable some of the persons
  now in custody to be tried; and most of the other Peers who spoke seemed
  to think that it would be either mischievous or useless. The only
  confident opinion expressed was that of the elderly Privy Councillor, who
  from the steps of the Throne ejaculated, "If you pass this Bill you may
  kill England, not Ireland." But despite this unconventional warning the
  Peers took the risk.</p>

  <p>The event of the day in the House of Commons was Colonel <font
  class="sc">Wedgwood's</font> tie. Of ample dimensions and of an
  ultra-scarlet hue that even a London and South-Western Railway porter
  might envy, it dominated the proceedings throughout Question-time. Beside
  it Mr. <font class="sc">Claude Lowther's</font> pink shirt paled its
  ineffectual fires.</p>

  <p>When Viscount <font class="sc">Curzon</font> renewed his
  anti-charabancs campaign and Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> was
  doing his best to maintain an even mind amid the contradictory
  suggestions showered upon him, the Ministerial eye was caught by the red
  gleam from Colonel <font class="sc">Wedgwood's</font> shirt-front. At
  once, the old railway instinct reasserted itself. Recognizing the
  danger-signal and hastily cramming on his brakes, Sir <font
  class="sc">Eric</font> observed that it would be "a great calamity" to
  prevent the economic use of the charabancs.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, August 10th.</i>&mdash;As Lord Great Chamberlain, and
  therefore official custodian of the Palace of Westminster, Lord <font
  class="sc">Lincolnshire</font> mentioned with due solemnity the
  regrettable incident of the day before. Lord <font
  class="sc">Curzon</font> thought the offender (the Right Hon. A. <font
  class="sc">Carlisle</font>) should be allowed to explain his behaviour,
  and suggested that he should himself address to him a suitable letter.
  Several noble lords&mdash;anticipating, no doubt, that, whatever else
  came of it, the correspondence would furnish lively reading&mdash;said
  "Hear, hear."</p>

  <p>A week ago the Peers decided by a very small majority&mdash;28 to
  23&mdash;that there should be no Minister of Mines, but only an
  Under-Secretary. Lord <font class="sc">Peel</font> now sought to induce
  them to change their minds. His principal argument was that a Minister
  would only cost five hundred pounds a year more than a Secretary and
  would secure the "harmony in the coal-trade" now so conspicuously
  lacking. The Peers evidently thought this too good to be true, for they
  proceeded to reassert their previous decision by 48 to 23.</p>

    <p>A DISTINGUISHED STRANGER.</p>

    <p><font class="sc">M. Krassin contemplates the Commons</font>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>There was a big assemblage in the Commons to hear the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> statement on Poland. The Duke of <font
  class="sc">York</font> was over the Clock, flanked by the Archbishop of
  <font class="sc">Canterbury</font> on one side and Messrs. <font
  class="sc">Kameneff</font> and <font class="sc">Krassin</font> (who
  sound, but do not look, like a music-hall "turn") on the other.</p>

  <p>Some facts bearing, more or less, on the situation were revealed at
  Question-time. Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font> denied that he had
  ever suggested an alliance with the Germans against Bolshevism, and, as
  we are keeping the Watch on the Rhine <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> with only thirteen
  thousand men&mdash;just three thousand more than it takes to garrison
  London&mdash;perhaps it is just as well. He has, I gathered, no great
  opinion of the Bolshevists as soldiers. In his endeavour to describe the
  disgust of our troops in North Russia at being ordered to retire before
  "an enemy they cordially despised" he nearly dislocated his upper
  lip.</p>

  <p>For two-thirds of his speech the <font class="sc">Prime
  Minister</font> was the sober statesman, discussing with due solemnity
  the grave possibilities of the Russo-Polish crisis. The Poles had been
  rash and must take the consequences. We should not help them unless the
  Bolshevists, not content with punishment, threatened the extinction of
  Poland's independence.</p>

  <p>Then his mood changed, and for a sparkling quarter of an hour he
  chaffed the Labour Party for its support of the Soviet Government, an
  unrepresentative self-appointed oligarchy. To make his point he even
  sacrificed a colleague. <font class="sc">Lenin</font> was an aristocrat,
  <font class="sc">Trotsky</font> a journalist. "In fact"&mdash;turning to
  Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font>&mdash;"my right honourable friend
  is an embodiment of both."</p>

  <p>A brief struggle for precedence between Mr. <font
  class="sc">Asquith</font> and Mr. <font class="sc">Adamson</font> ended
  in favour of the <font class="sc">ex-Premier</font>, who doubted whether
  the best way to ensure peace was to attack one of the parties to the
  dispute, and proceeded to make things more or less even by vigorously
  chiding Poland for her aggression. Mr. <font class="sc">Clynes</font>,
  while admitting that the Labour Party would have to reconsider its
  position if the independence of Poland was threatened, still maintained
  that we had not played a straight game from Russia.</p>

  <p>Later on, through the medium of Lieut.-Commander <font
  class="sc">Kenworthy</font>, communication was established between the
  Treasury Bench and the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> read the terms offered by the Soviet to
  the Poles, and gave them a guarded approval.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, August 11th.</i>&mdash;A Bill to prohibit ready-money
  betting on football matches was introduced by Lord <font
  class="sc">Gainford</font> (who played for Cambridge forty years ago) and
  supported by Lord <font class="sc">Meath</font>, "a most enthusiastic
  player" of a still earlier epoch. The Peers could not resist the pleading
  of these experts and gave the Bill a second reading; but when Lord <font
  class="sc">Gainford</font> proposed to rush it through goal straightaway
  his course was barred by Lord <font class="sc">Birkenhead</font>, an
  efficient Lord "Keeper."</p>

  <p>A proposal for the erection at the public expense of a statue of the
  late Mr. <font class="sc">Joseph Chamberlain</font> furnished occasion
  for the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Asquith</font> to indulge in generous praise of a political
  opponent. Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> (with his eye on the
  Sovietists) pointed out that, as this was "essentially a Parliamentary
  country," we did well to honour "a great Parliamentarian"; and the <font
  class="sc">ex-Premier</font> (with his eye on Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd
  George</font>) selected for special note among Mr. <font
  class="sc">Chamberlain's</font> characteristics that he had "no blurred
  edges."</p>

  <p>A humdrum debate on the Consolidation Fund Bill was interrupted by the
  startling news that France had decided, in direct opposition to the
  policy announced yesterday by the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font>,
  to give immediate recognition to General <font class="sc">Wrangel</font>.
  Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> expressed his "surprise and
  anxiety" and could only suppose that there had been an unfortunate
  misunderstanding. To give time for its removal the House decided to
  postpone its holiday and adjourned till Monday.</p>

<hr />

<h4>More Headaches for the Historian.</h4>

  <p>Messrs. <font class="sc">Kameneff</font> and <font
  class="sc">Krassin</font>, the Soviet envoys, were in the Distinguished
  Strangers' Gallery during the <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font>
  speech on Poland last week. Hence these tears:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"In conversation they seem to betray only a limited acquaintance with
  English, but every word of Mr. Lloyd George's utterance seemed
  intelligible to them. Not only did they follow him with eager interest,
  but often with animated comment."&mdash;<i>Evening Standard</i>.</p>

  <p>"The two did not exchange a single remark during the whole of the
  Premier's speech." <i>Evening News</i>.</p>

  <p>"Krassin could follow every word of Lloyd George. His colleague
  doesn't speak or understand English, so Krassin every few minutes leaned
  over and whispered a translation into the other's
  ear."&mdash;<i>Star</i>.</p>

  <p>"The Soviet envoys, especially M. Krassin, seemed somewhat restless,
  and appeared to take more interest in the scene than in the speech, but
  this I heard attributed to their difficulty in following the words of the
  Prime Minister."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p>

<h3>BLEWITT ON REAL PROPERTY.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>229th ed., folio, 2 vols.</i> (<i>Sour and Taxwell, 85s.</i>).</p>

  <p>All persons interested in this entrancing subject will welcome the new
  edition of Mr. Blewitt's famous work. The book is one which should be
  found on every shelf throughout the country, and is undoubtedly, in its
  combination of erudition and artistic merit, one of the masterpieces of
  English literature. It has been well described by a more competent critic
  as one which "it is difficult to take up when once you have put it down,"
  and in this judgment most readers will, we believe, concur.</p>

  <p>It seems needless for us to say anything about so well-known a work,
  and to say anything new is, we believe, impossible. Mr. Blewitt is
  invariably happy in his choice of subject, and in this treatise on
  <i>Real Property</i> his sparkling wit, his light style and clearness of
  expression do ample justice to the perennial freshness of his subject.
  The reader is swiftly carried from situation to situation and thrill
  follows thrill with daring rapidity. The plot is of the simplest, but
  worked out with surprising skill, while the events are related with that
  vivid imagination which the subject demands. Who is there that does not
  feel a glow of exaltation and rejoice with the heir when he comes, upon
  reversion, into the property from which he has been so long excluded? Mr.
  Blewitt treats this incident with a sense of romance and picturesqueness
  of language reminiscent of the ballad of "The Lord of Lynn." In its facts
  the ballad bears a striking resemblance to those so graphically described
  by our author, but in point of execution lacks the true breath of poetic
  inspiration which pervades Mr. Blewitt's book.</p>

  <p>Nor is his work wanting in pathos. There are few who will not
  sympathise with the hero when he discovers that the life-estate of the
  fair widow whom he adores with all the fierce yearnings of his passionate
  soul is subject to a collateral limitation to widowhood. Mr. Blewitt's
  silence on the disappointment which embittered his spirit and the doubts
  which tormented his mind is more eloquent than any soliloquy of
  <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not however in description but in characterisation that Mr.
  Blewitt is pre-eminent. We know of nothing in works of this nature to
  equal the skilful psychological analysis, the sympathy of treatment and
  the fidelity to nature with which the author draws line by line the
  character of Q. The description of him as seised in fee simple is a touch
  of genius. We can remember nothing <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> in the English language
  to compare with this unless it be that brilliant passage in which Mr.
  Blewitt sketches in a few lightning strokes the character of Richard Roe,
  a man at once pugnacious, overbearing, litigious and utterly regardless
  of truth and honesty.</p>

  <p>The learned editors have rendered a great service to the cause of
  learning in publishing this new edition. The editing is very creditable
  to English scholarship. The additional matter is a new note on page 1069,
  in which the reader is referred to an article in a recent number of the
  <i>Timbuctoo Law Review</i>, which, in fairness to the editor (of <i>Real
  Property</i>), is not, of course, quoted here. The student will, we have
  no doubt, feel himself fully recompensed by this new matter for the price
  of the new volumes and the depreciation of the 228th edition.</p>

  seven wickets of 168."&mdash;<i>Welsh Paper.</i></p>

<h2>WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BOYS.</h2>

  <p>As a sufferer from the prevailing complaint, house-famine, I have
  started a Correspondence Bureau, ostensibly for advising parents as to
  the pursuits their offspring should take up, but really for propaganda
  purposes, the object being the assuagement of this terrible evil.</p>

  <p>Consequently my replies to inquiries are all moulded to this end.</p>

  <p>For instance, one mother wrote from Surbiton:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My second son, Algernon, wishes to become a house and estate agent.
  Do please tell me if you think this quite a fitting avocation for one
  whose father is a member of the Stock Exchange."</p>

  <p>I replied, "Quite. There is no nobler, and incidentally there are few
  more lucrative occupations outside Bradford, unless it be that of a
  builder, in which the scope is absolutely unlimited. I am enclosing a
  copy of last week's <i>Builder and Architect</i>, in which you will find
  some great thoughts expressed. Pray let Algernon read it. It may be the
  means of inducing him to perform great deeds for England's sake."</p>

  <p>Another fond parent wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Can you advise an anxious mother as to a career for her only son,
  John William? He is at present eight and a-half years old, has blue eyes
  and fair hair and is a perfect darling, so good and obedient, but he is
  firmly resolved to be a lift-man when he grows up."</p>

  <p>I answered her soothingly thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"John Willie is rather young to have made a final decision, I think.
  Let his youthful aspirations run through the usual stages, liftman,
  engine-driver, bus-conductor, sailor, etc. At fifteen or so he will have
  left these behind, and for the next few years will probably settle down
  to the idea of being nothing in particular, or else a professional
  cricketer. Then he will suddenly, for good or evil, make his choice.
  Neither his blue eyes nor his fair hair give any clue as to what that
  choice will be, but I should let him keep both, as they may be useful to
  him.</p>

  <p>"If he should determine upon a career involving manual work, I should
  take steps to have him initiated into the Art and Mystery of Bricklaying.
  At the rate we are moving the working-hours would probably be about eight
  per week, with approximately eight pounds per day salary, by the time he
  arrives at bricklaying maturity.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to say yet whether he would have to graduate in
  Commerce before being eligible, but probably it would be necessary, as
  the best bricklayers, I'm told, always carry a mortar-board, and there is
  a sort of caucus in these plummy professions nowadays that is anxious to
  keep outsiders from joining their ranks. But the country needs
  bricklayers, and will go on needing them for years. Let John Willie step
  forward when he is old enough."</p>

  <p>To the mother who asked if I considered that her youngest boy would be
  well advised to adopt the Housebreaking profession I wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To which part of this profession do you refer? If to the Burgling
  branch I would ask, 'Has he the iron nerve, the indomitable will, above
  all has he the brain power for this exacting craft? Can he stand the
  exposure to the night air, the exposure before an Assize jury, and the
  rigours of the Portland stone quarries?' If so, let him take a course of
  illustrated lectures at the cinema.</p>

  <p>"If you refer to the other branch, the mere pulling down of houses, I
  say, 'No! A thousand times, no!' He should be taught that there is a
  crying need for a constructive, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
  id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> not a destructive policy. Let him adopt
  one; buy him drawing-paper and a tee-square at once, and teach him that
  the noblest work of creation is (unless it be a bricklayer or builder) an
  architect. Though the War is over we must still keep the home fires
  burning. This implies chimneys, and chimneys imply houses, and few there
  be that can plan houses that will both please the eye and pass the local
  authorities."</p>

  <p>Lady Jubb wrote from Toffley Hall, Blankshire, to say that her elder
  son (seventeen) had no ideas for the future beyond becoming Master of the
  Barchester when he grew up, but that she was anxious that he should try
  for some more lucrative post, official preferred.</p>

  <p>I replied thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"So your son looks no higher than a Mastership of Foxhounds. Well,
  well, I suppose that so long as there are such things as hounds he, as
  well as another, may take on the job of Master.</p>

  <p>"But I thoroughly approve of your desire that he should try for
  something higher in life, especially for some official post; and what
  official post is or can be superior to that of a Borough Surveyor? Can
  you not persuade him that this great office is what one chooses to make
  it, and that, as an autocrat, the M.F.H. is hardly to be compared to the
  B.S., for, whereas the former can at the most scorch the few people
  foolish enough to remain within ear-shot, the latter can with a breath
  damn a whole row of houses and blast the careers of an army of builders
  with a word."</p>

  <p>And so the propaganda proceeds.</p>

  <p>If my efforts result in even one house being erected I shall, I think,
  have earned my O.B.E., though I would rather have the house.</p>

<h3>A TASTE OF AUTHORITY.</h3>

  <p>I have often wished I were an expert at something. How I envy the man
  who, before ordering a suit of clothes from his tailor, seizes the
  proffered sample of cloth and tugs at it in a knowledgable manner, smells
  it at close quarters with deep inhalations and finally, if he is very
  brave, pulls out a thread and ignites it with a match. Whereupon the
  tailor, abashed and discomfited, produces for the lucky expert from the
  interior of his premises that choice bale of pre-war quality which he was
  keeping for his own use.</p>

  <p>I confided this yearning of mine to Rottenbury the other evening.
  Rottenbury is a man of the world and might, I thought, be able to help
  me.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "in these days of specialisation one has to
  be brought up in the business to be an expert in anything, whether cloth
  or canaries or bathroom tiling. Knowledge of this kind is not gained in a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Can you help me?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"As regards tea, I can," he replied. "Jorkins over there is in the tea
  business. If you like I'll get him to put you up to the tricks of
  tea-tasting."</p>

  <p>"I should be awfully glad if you would," said I. "We never get any
  decent tea at home."</p>

  <p>Jorkins appeared to be a man of direct and efficient character. I saw
  Rottenbury speak to him and the next moment he was at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"Watch me carefully," said Jorkins, "and listen to what I say. Take a
  little leaf into the palm of your left hand. Rub it lightly with the
  fingers and gaze earnestly thus. Apply your nose and snuff up strongly.
  Pick out a strand and bite through the leaf slowly with the front teeth,
  thus. Just after biting pass the tip of the tongue behind the front teeth
  and along the palate, completing the act of deglutition. Sorry I must go
  now. Good day."</p>

  <p>Now I felt I was on the right track. I practised the thing a few times
  before a glass, paying special attention to the far-away poetical look
  which Jorkins wore during the operation.</p>

  <p>At the tea-shop the man behind the counter willingly showed me numbers
  of teas. I snatched a handful of that which he specially recommended and
  began the ceremony. I took a little into the palm of my left-hand and
  gazed at it earnestly; I rubbed it lightly with my fingers; I picked up a
  strand and bit through the leaf slowly with the front teeth. Just after
  biting I passed the tongue behind the front teeth and along the palate,
  completing the act of deglutition.</p>

  <p>So far as I could judge it was very good tea, but it would never do to
  accept the first sample offered; I must let the shopman see that he was
  up against one of the mandarins of the trade. So I said with severity,
  "Please don't show me any more common stuff; I want the best you
  have."</p>

  <p>The man looked at me curiously and I saw his face twitching; he was
  evidently about to speak.</p>

  <p>"Kindly refrain from expostulating," I went on; "content yourself with
  showing me your finest blend."</p>

  <p>He went away to the back of the shop, muttering; clearly he recognised
  defeat, for when he returned he carried a small chest.</p>

  <p>"Try this," said he, and I knew that he was boiling with baffled
  rage.</p>

  <p>I took a handful and once more went through the whole ceremony. It was
  nauseating, but the man was obviously impressed. At the conclusion of my
  performance I assumed a look of satisfaction. "Give me five pounds of
  that," said I with the air of a conqueror.</p>

  <p>Next time I met Rottenbury I told him of my success.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jorkins put you up to the trick, did he?"</p>

  <p>"He did. He taught me to titillate, to triturate, to masticate, to
  deglute&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>"And with what result?"</p>

  <p>"With the result that I have in my possession five pounds of the
  finest tea that the greatest experts have blended from the combined
  products of Assam and China."</p>

  <p>"Tea?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, tea of course. You didn't suppose that I was talking of
  oysters?"</p>

  <p>"Did I tell you Jorkins was a tea-taster?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, he's not. He's in tobacco."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Alured," said my wife, "I wish you wouldn't buy things for the house.
  That tea is low-grade sweepings."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>To review one of Mr. <font class="sc">E.F. Benson's</font> social
  satires always gives me somewhat the sensations of the reporter at the
  special sermon&mdash;a relieved consciousness that, being present on
  business, my own withers may be supposed professionally unwrung.
  Otherwise, so exploratory a lash.... I seldom recall the touch of it more
  shrewd than in <i>Queen Lucia</i> (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>),
  an altogether delightful castigation of those persons whom a false
  rusticity causes to change a good village into the sham-bucolic home of
  crazes, fads and affectation. All this super-cultured life of the
  Riseholme community has its centre in <i>Mrs. Lucas</i>, the acknowledged
  queen of the place (<i>Lucia</i> = wife of <i>Lucas</i>, which shows you
  the character of her empire in a single touch); the matter of the tale is
  to tell how her autocracy was threatened, tottered and recovered. I wish
  I had space to quote the description of the <i>Lucas</i> home,
  "converted" from two genuine cottages, to which had been added a wing at
  right-angles, even more Elizabethan than the original, and a yew-hedge,
  "brought entire from a neighbouring farm and transplanted with solid
  lumps of earth and indignant snails around its roots." Perhaps, apart
  from the joy of the setting, you may find some of the incidents, the
  faith-healer, the medium and so on, a trifle obvious for Mr. <font
  class="sc">Benson</font>. More worthy of him is the central
  episode&mdash;the arrival as a Riseholme resident of <i>Olga Bracely</i>,
  the operatic star of international fame. Her talk, her attitude towards
  the place, and the subtle contrast suggested by her between the genuine
  and the pretence, show Mr. <font class="sc">Benson</font> at his
  light-comedy best. In short, a charming entertainment, in speaking of
  which you will observe I have not once so much as mentioned the word
  "Cotswolds."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Michael Forth</i> (<font class="sc">Constable</font>) will
  doubtless convey a wonderful message to those of us who are clever enough
  to grasp its meaning; but I fear that it will be a disappointment to many
  admirers of Miss <font class="sc">Mary Johnston's</font> earlier books.
  Frankly I confess myself bewildered and unable to follow this excursion
  into the region of metaphysics; indeed I felt as if I had fallen into the
  hands of a guide whose language I could only dimly and dully understand.
  All of which may be almost entirely my fault, so I suggest that you
  should sample <i>Michael</i> for yourselves and see what you can make of
  him. Miss <font class="sc">Johnston</font> shouldered an unnecessarily
  heavy burden when she decided to tell the story of her hero in the first
  person, but in relating <i>Michael's</i> childhood in his Virginian home
  she is at her simplest and best. Afterwards, when <i>Michael</i> became
  intent on going "deeper and deeper within," he succeeded so well that he
  concealed himself from me.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Because I have a warm regard for good short stories and heartily
  approve the growing fashion of publishing or republishing them in volume
  form, I am the more jealous that the good repute of this practice should
  be preserved from damage by association with unworthy material. I'm
  afraid this is a somewhat ominous introduction to a notice of <i>The Eve
  of Pascua</i> (<font class="sc">Heinemann</font>), in which, to be
  brutally frank, I found little justification for even such longevity as
  modern paper conditions permit. "<font class="sc">Richard Dehan</font>"
  is admittedly a writer who has deserved well of the public, but none of
  the tales in this collection will do <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> anything to add to the
  debt. The best is perhaps a very short and quite happily told little jest
  called "An Impression," about the emotions of a peasant model on seeing
  herself as interpreted by an Impressionist painter. There is also a
  sufficiently picturesque piece of Wardour Street medievalism in "The
  Tribute of the Kiss," and some original scenery in "The Mother of
  Turquoise." But beyond this (though I searched diligently) nothing;
  indeed worse, since more than one of the remaining tales, notably
  "Wanted, a King" and "The End of the Cotillion," are so preposterous that
  their inclusion here can only be attributed to the most cynical
  indifference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It may be my Saxon prejudice, but, though most of the ingredients of
  <i>Irish Stew</i> (<font class="sc">Skeffington</font>) are in fact
  Irish, and though Mrs. <font class="sc">Dorothea Conyers</font> is best
  known as a novelist who delights in traditional Ireland and traditional
  horses, I am bound to confess that I enjoyed the adventures of <i>Mr.
  Jones</i>, trusted employé of <i>Mosenthals and Co.</i>, better than Mrs.
  <font class="sc">Conyers</font>' stage Irishmen. "Our Mr. Jones" is
  neither a <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> nor an <i>Aristide Pujol</i>, neither a
  <i>Father Brown</i> nor a <i>Bob Pretty</i>, but nevertheless he is an
  engaging soul and we could do with more of him. Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Conyers</font>' hunting <i>clientèle</i> may much prefer to
  read about the dishonesties of <i>Con Cassidy</i> and his
  fellow-horse-copers and the simple but heroic <i>O'Toole</i> and his
  supernatural friends. But, as the average Irish hunting man cares little
  more for books than he does for bill-collectors, his preference may not
  be of paramount importance. In any case the Irish ingredients of <i>Irish
  Stew</i> would be easier to assimilate if Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Conyers</font> would refrain from trying to spell English as
  the Irish speak it. If the reader knows Ireland it is unnecessary and
  merely makes reading a task. If the reader does not know Ireland no
  amount of phonetic spelling will reproduce a single one of the
  multitudinous brogues that fill Erin with sound and empty it of sense. On
  the whole Mrs. <font class="sc">Conyers</font>' public will not be
  disappointed with her latest sheaf of tales. But it is <i>Mr. Jones</i>
  who will give them their money's worth.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I was, I confess, a little sceptical&mdash;you know how it
  is&mdash;when I read what Messrs. <font class="sc">Hodder and
  Stoughton's</font> official reviewer said of Mr. <font class="sc">Hal. G.
  Evarts</font>' <i>The Cross-Pull</i>: "The best dog story since The Call
  of the Wild," etc., etc. Well, I certainly haven't seen a better. Mr.
  <font class="sc">Evarts</font>' hero, <i>Flash</i>, is a noble beast of
  mixed strain&mdash;grey wolf, coyote, dog. The Cross-Pull is the conflict
  between the dog and the wolf, between loyalty to his master and mistress
  whom he brings together and serves, and the wolf whose proper business is
  to be biting elks in the neck. Happier than most tamed brutes he is
  involved as chief actor in a round up of some desperate outlaws, among
  whom is his chief enemy, and he is fortunate enough to serve the state
  while pursuing to a successful end his bitter private quarrel. Brute
  <i>Brent</i> gets and deserves the kind of bite which was planned by a
  far-seeing providence for the elk.... You can tell when an author really
  loves and knows animals or is merely "putting it on." Mr. <font
  class="sc">Evarts</font> understands, sentimentalises less than most
  interpreters; seems to know a good deal. The story loses no interest from
  being set in the American hinterland of a few decades ago. All real
  animal lovers should get this book&mdash;they should really.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>If it be true art, as I rather think someone has said it is, to state
  what is obvious in regard to a subject while creating by the manner of
  the statement an impression of its subtler features, then Mr. <font
  class="sc">Percy Brown</font>, in writing <i>Germany in Dissolution</i>
  (<font class="sc">Melrose</font>), has proved himself a true artist. For
  in Germany about the time of the Armistice and during the Spartacist
  rising certain things happened which got themselves safely into the
  newspapers, and these he sets forth, mostly in headline form. Beyond this
  Germany was a seething muddle of contradictions and cross-purposes,
  which, it is hardly unfair to say, are capably reflected in his pages.
  Mr. <font class="sc">Brown</font> is a journalist of the school that does
  not stick at a trifle, a German prison, for instance, when his dear
  public wants news. His crowning achievement was to persuade Dr. <font
  class="sc">Solf</font>, when Foreign Minister, to send through the
  official wireless an account of an interview with himself, which would,
  as he (<font class="sc">Solf</font>) fondly hoped, help to bamboozle
  British public opinion. When the article appeared, so well had the
  author's editor read between the lines of the message that the journalist
  had to run for his life. He was particularly fortunate too, or clever, in
  getting in touch with the Kiel sailors who set the revolution going, but
  in spite of much excellent material, mostly of the "scoop" interview
  variety, nothing much ever seems to come of it all, and we are left at
  the end about as wise as we started. All the same, much of the book's
  detail is interesting, however little satisfaction it offers as a
  whole.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Ann's First Flutter</i> (<font class="sc">Allen and Unwin</font>)
  will not arouse any commotion in the dovecotes of the intellectually
  elect, but it provides an amusing entertainment for those who can
  appreciate broad and emphatic humour. Mr. R.A. <font
  class="sc">Hamblin</font> has succeeded in what he set out to do, and my
  only quarrel with him is that I believe him to have a subtler sense of
  humour than he reveals here. <i>Ann</i> was a grocer's daughter, and
  after her attempt to flutter for herself had failed she married <i>Tom
  Bampfield</i>, a grocer's son. <i>Tom</i> had literary ambitions, and was
  the author of a novel which his father thought pernicious enough to
  destroy his custom. Strange however to relate, the novel failed to
  destroy anything except the author's future as a novelist, and when
  <i>Tom</i> did succeed in making some pen-money it was by means of a
  series of funny articles in <i>The Dry Goods Gazette</i>&mdash;articles
  so violently humorous that the author's father thoroughly appreciated
  them. Mr. <font class="sc">Hamblin's</font> fun, let me add, is never
  ill-natured. Even bilious grocers will not resent his jovial invasion of
  their kingdom.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
